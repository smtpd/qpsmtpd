"Before enabling qpsmtpd, you must first configure your local MTA not to bind "
"to the SMTP TCP port on at least one interface.  The most common approach is "
"to leave your MTA listening on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1), with "
"qpsmtpd listening on the external interface.  Instructions for configuring "
"common MTAs to work with qpsmtpd can be found after installation in /usr/"
"share/doc/qpsmtpd/README.Debian."

"Qpsmtpd supports two process models for handling connections.  The "
"'forkserver' model uses a single process when idle, and forks new processes "
"to handle connections.  This uses less memory but slightly reduces server "
"throughput.  The 'prefork' model keeps a pool of idle processes available to "
"handle new connections, offering slightly better performance at the cost of "
"more memory."
