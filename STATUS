Roadmap
=======

 - http://code.google.com/p/smtpd/issues

 - Bugfixes - qpsmtpd is extremely stable (in production since 2001), but
   there are always more things to fix.

 - Add user configuration plugin infrastructure
   - Add plugin API for checking if a local email address is valid

 - Add API to reject individual recipients after the RCPT has been
   accepted and generate individual bounce messages.

Issues
======

See http://code.google.com/p/smtpd/issues/list

------ The rest of the list here might be outdated. ------
------ Patches to remove things are welcome.        ------


add whitelist support to the dnsbl plugin (and maybe to the rhsbl
plugin too).  Preferably both supporting DNS based whitelists and
filebased (CDB) ones.


plugin support;

  allow plugins to return multiple response lines (does it have to
  join them to one for SMTP?)

  support plugins for the rest of the commands.

  specify a priority in register_hook. ("LAST", "FIRST", "MIDDLE", or
  maybe a number)

  plugin access to the data line by line during the DATA phase
  (instead of just after)

  if qmail-queue can't be loaded we still return 250 ?!

Make a system for configuring the plugins per user/domain/...

  support databytes per user / domain

localiphost - support foo@[a.b.c.d] addresses 

Move dispatch() etc from SMTP.pm to Qpsmtpd.pm to allow other similar
protocols to use the qpsmtpd framework. 



Future Ideas
============

Methods to create a bounce message easily; partly so we can accept a
mail for one user but bounce it right away for another RCPT'er.

The data_post hook should be able to put in the notes what addresses
should go through, bounce and get rejected respectively, and qpsmtpd
should just do the right thing.  See also
