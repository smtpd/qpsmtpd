Qpsmtpd - an SMTP daemon for developers and hackers

Roadmap
=======

 - https://github.com/smtpd/qpsmtpd/issues

 - Add user configuration plugin infrastructure
   - Add plugin API for checking if a local email address is valid

Issues
======

plugin support;

  allow plugins to return multiple response lines (does it have to
  join them to one for SMTP?)

  support plugins for the rest of the commands.

  specify a priority in register_hook. ("LAST", "FIRST", "MIDDLE", or
  maybe a number)

  plugin access to the data line by line during the DATA phase
  (instead of just after)

  if qmail-queue can't be loaded we still return 250 ?!

localiphost - support foo@[a.b.c.d] addresses 

Move dispatch() etc from SMTP.pm to Qpsmtpd.pm to allow other similar
protocols to use the qpsmtpd framework.
