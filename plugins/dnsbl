=head1 Usage

Add the following line to the config/plugins file:

  dnsbl [disconnect]

If you want to immediately drop the connection (since some blacklisted 
servers attempt multiple sends per session), add the optional keyword 
"disconnect" (case insensitive) to the config line.  In most cases, an
IP address that is listed should not be given the opportunity to begin
a new transaction, since even the most volatile blacklists will return
the same answer for a short period of time (the minimum DNS cache period).

=head1 Configuration files

This plugin uses the following configuration files. All of these are optional.
However, not specifying dnsbl_zones is like not using the plugin at all.

=over 4

=item dnsbl_zones

Normal ip based dns blocking lists ("RBLs") which contain TXT records are
specified simply as:

  relays.ordb.org
  spamsources.fabel.dk

To configure RBL services which do not contain TXT records in the DNS,
but only A records (e.g. the RBL+ at http://www.mail-abuse.org), specify your
own error message to return in the SMTP conversation after a colon e.g.

  rbl-plus.mail-abuse.org:You are listed at - http://http://www.mail-abuse.org/cgi-bin/lookup?%IP%

The string %IP% will be replaced with the IP address of incoming connection.
Thus a fully specified file could be:

  sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org
  list.dsbl.org
  rbl-plus.mail-abuse.ja.net:Listed by rbl-plus.mail-abuse.ja.net - see <URL:http://www.mail-abuse.org/cgi-bin/lookup?%IP%>
  relays.ordb.org

=item dnsbl_allow

List of allowed ip addresses that bypass RBL checking. Format is one entry per line,
with either a full IP address or a truncated IP address with a period at the end.
For example:

  192.168.1.1
  172.16.33.

NB the environment variable RBLSMTPD is considered before this file is 
referenced. See below.

=item dnsbl_rejectmsg

A textual message that is sent to the sender on an RBL failure. The TXT record
from the RBL list is also sent, but this file can be used to indicate what
action the sender should take.

For example:

   If you think you have been blocked in error, then please forward
   this entire error message to your ISP so that they can fix their problems.
   The next line often contains a URL that can be visited for more information.

=head1 Environment Variables

=head2 RBLSMTPD

The environment variable RBLSMTPD is supported and mimics the behaviour of
Dan Bernstein's rblsmtpd. The exception to this is the '-' char at the 
start of RBLSMTPD which is used to force a hard error in Dan's rblsmtpd.
NB I don't really see the benefit
of using a soft error for a site in an RBL list. This just complicates
things as it takes 7 days (or whatever default period) before a user
gets an error email back. In the meantime they are complaining that their
emails are being "lost" :(

=over 4

=item RBLSMTPD is set and non-empty

The contents are used as the SMTP conversation error.
Use this for forcibly blocking sites you don't like

=item RBLSMTPD is set, but empty

In this case no RBL checks are made.
This can be used for local addresses.

=item RBLSMTPD is not set

All RBL checks will be made.
This is the setting for remote sites that you want to check against RBL.
