=head1 NAME

transaction_id - plugin to demo use of the transaction id

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A qpsmtpd plugin which replicates the built in logging functionality, which
is to send all logging messages to STDERR below a specific log level.

This plugin differs from logging/warn only by using the transaction id
instead of the pid to demonstrate the effect of different algorithms.

=head1 INSTALL AND CONFIG

Place this plugin in the plugin/logging directory beneath the standard
qpsmtpd installation.  Edit the config/logging file and add a line like
this:

  logging/transaction_id [loglevel]

where the optional parameters C<loglevel> is either the numeric or text
representation of the maximum log level, as shown in the
L<config.sample/loglevel> file.
