=head1 NAME

authdeny

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This plugin doesn't actually check anything and will fail any
user no matter what they type.  It is strictly a proof of concept for
the Qpsmtpd::Auth module.  Don't run this in production!!!

=cut

sub hook_auth {
    my ($self, $transaction, $method, $user, $passClear, $passHash, $ticket) =
      @_;

    $self->log(LOGWARN, "fail: cannot authenticate");

    return DECLINED, "$user is not free to abuse my relay";
}
