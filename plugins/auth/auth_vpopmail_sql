=head1 NAME

auth_vpopmail_sql - Authenticate to vpopmail via MySQL

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin authenticates vpopmail users directly against a standard
vpopmail MySQL database.  It makes the not-unreasonable assumption that
both pw_name and pw_domain are lowercase only (qmail doesn't actually care).
If you are using CRAM-MD5, it also requires that vpopmail be built with the
recommended '--enable-clear-passwd=y' option, because there is no way
to compare the crypted password.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

 echo "dbi:mysql:dbname=vpopmail;host=127.0.0.1" > config/vpopmail_mysql_dsn
 echo "vpopmailuser" > config/vpopmail_mysql_user
 echo "vpoppasswd" > config/vpopmail_mysql_pass

This can be a read-only database user since the plugin does not update the
last accessed time (yet, see below).

This module supports PLAIN, LOGIN, and CRAM-MD5 authentication methods. You
can disable undesired methods by editing this module and uncommenting
the lines in the register() sub.  See the POD for Qspmtpd::Auth for more
details on the ramifications of supporting various authentication methods.

The remote user must login with a fully qualified e-mail address (i.e. both
account name and domain), even if they don't normally need to.  This is
because the vpopmail table has a unique index on pw_name/pw_domain, and this
module requires that only a single record be returned from the database.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

This authentication modules does not recognize domain aliases. So, if you have
the domain example.com, with domain aliases for example.org and example.net,
smtp-auth will only work for $user@example.com. If you have domain aliases,
consider using another plugin (see SEE ALSO).

=head1 FUTURE DIRECTION

The default MySQL configuration for vpopmail includes a table to log access,
lastauth, which could conceivably be updated upon sucessful authentication.
The addition of this feature is left as an exercise for someone who cares. ;)
