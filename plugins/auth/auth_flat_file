=head1 NAME

auth_flat_file - simple CRAM MD5 auth plugin using a flat password file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

in config/plugins:

  auth/auth_flat_file

in config/flat_auth_pw

  username1:password1
  username2:password2
  ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin implements a very simple authentication plugin using a flat password
file containing username and password separated by colons.

Note that this plugin enforces the use of a full email address (including
@domain) as the username. There's no particular reason for this so feel free
to modify the code to suit your setup.

The password is stored on disk unencrypted, however authentication uses a HMAC
algorithm so no password is transfered in the clear.
