=head1 NAME

check_basicheaders - Make sure both From and Date headers are present, and
do optional range checking on the Date header.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Rejects messages that do not have a From or Date header or are completely
empty.

Can also reject messages where the date in the Date header is more than
some number of the days in the past or future.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Takes one optional parameter, the number of days in the future or past
beyond which to reject messages. (The default is to not reject messages
based on the date.)
