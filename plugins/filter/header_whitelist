=head1 SYNOPSIS

This plugin removes all mail headers not matching a certain whitelist.
This is almost certainly a bad idea for inbound mail, and may be
undesireable for general purpose outbound mail.

It is useful as a content filter:

C<http://www.postfix.org/FILTER_README.html>

to normalize outbound mail, probably from application servers that litter
the headers with various forms of useless junk.

=head1 CONFIG

config/header_whitelist

Each line is a header name without the colon. Headers not listed in the
whitelist are removed.
