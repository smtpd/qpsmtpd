When upgrading from:

v 0.84 or below

CHECK_RELAY, CHECK_NORELAY, RELAY_ONLY

    All 3 plugins are deprecated and replaced with a new 'relay' plugin. The new plugin reads the same config files (see 'perldoc plugins/relay') as the previous plugins. To get the equivalent functionality of enabling 'relay_only', use the 'only' argument to the relay plugin as documented in the RELAY ONLY section of plugins/relay.

GREYLISTING plugin:

    'mode' config argument is deprecated. Use reject and reject_type instead.

    The greylisting DB format has changed to accommodate IPv6 addresses. (The DB key has colon ':' seperated fields, and IPv6 addresses are colon delimited). The new format converts the IPs into integers. There is a new config option named 'upgrade' that when enabled, updates all the records in your DB to the new format. Simply add 'upgrade 1' to the plugin entry in config/plugins, start up qpsmtpd once, make one connection. A log entry will be made, telling how many records were upgraded. Remove the upgrade option from your config.

SPF plugin:

    spf_deny setting deprecated. Use reject N setting instead, which provides administrators with more granular control over SPF. For backward compatibility, a spf_deny setting of 1 is mapped to 'reject 3' and a 'spf_deny 2' is mapped to 'reject 4'.


P0F plugin:
    defaults to p0f v3 (was v2).

    Upgrade p0f to version 3 or add 'version 2' to your p0f line in config/plugins. perldoc plugins/ident/p0f for more details.
